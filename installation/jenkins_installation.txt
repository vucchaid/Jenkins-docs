# 1. Create a directory "jenkins"
mkdir $(pwd)/jenkins

# 2. Get into jenkins directory
cd jenkins

# 3. Create a file called "docker-compose.yml" and paste contents present in this [file]()
# This file has a sample blueprint of jenkins server. It will direct docker to install, start jenkins as per blueprint.


# 4. Create jenkins_home folder
mkdir jenkins_home
# This folder is written in blueprint present in step 3.
# This folder will hold the jenkins configurational data when the service is up.

# 5. Provide permissions to user to manage jenkins_home folder
sudo chown 1000:1000 jenkins_home -R

# Breakdown of above command:
# chown => change owner.
# 1000:1000 => new_owner/uid:new_group/gid (you can type "id" to see which uid, gid exisiting user has).
# jenkins_home => folder which we want to have new owner.
# -R => recursively.

# How to bring up service?
docker-compose up -d
# if you are setting up for first-time, 
# you can do "docker logs -f jenkins" to get the master password. 

# How to bring down service?
docker-compose down
# This will down the jenkins service. 
# However if you up the service again, it'll retain previous configuration
# because of previous configuration files present in "jenkins_home" folder.

# How to restart service?
docker-compose restart
# Straight forward, will stop and start the service.
