# Setting up remote hosts for Jenkins

If we want to run some scripts or commands in another system/host for various reasons such as running tasks parellely such as pinging a service to check if service is up or to run scripts parallely, then we use remote hosts to do it.

<br/>

Jenkins will SSH into the configured remote_host and will run the job in that host.
